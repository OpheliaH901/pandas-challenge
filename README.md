HeroesOfPymoli / Pandas Homework / Trend Analysis

As the Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company, I was responsible for analyzing the data of the fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli.
Many games in this genre are free of cost to simply play, but incentives that enhance each player's playing experience are available at a low cost.

Once the total player count and the total revenue was established, we were able to delve into each player's profile to gather demographics and order details. The first trend to stand out was that our biggest market were male high school and college students age groups. High school students are less likely to have a steady income or freedom to spend how they like since they are under parent's supervision. This explains the spike in the 20-24 age group. These individuals have the time to dedicate to gaming when not in class or part-time job. This age group also has more freedom to spend how they please so incentives at less than $5 are more attractive than higher age group with more responsibilities, such as household maintenance expenses and families.

The decrease in purchases as the age group increases could very well be due to lifestyle changes and free time available. The older we get, the less time we have to do things we enjoy. Even though a higher age group (25-34) may enjoy gaming as leisure activity, paying for a better gaming experience is not a priority. There was an $800+ decrease from the 20-24 to  25-29 age group.
